# st3-config
This is my ```Sublime Text 3/Packages/User``` folder, which contains user settings & packages for package control to install. Built for Sublime Text 3.

## How to use

* Install [Sublime Text 3](www.sublimetext.com/3).
* Start Sublime Text at least once, and install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).
* Close Sublime Text.
* Clone repo into either ```~/AppData/Roaming/Sublime Text 3/Packages``` (Windows) or ```~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages``` (OS X).
* ```$ rm -rf User```
* ```$ mv st3-config User```
* Start Sublime Text. Package control will automagically download all packages. No restart required. :thumbsup:
